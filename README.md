# CH Products Joystick Map for Start Citizen

This map is currently a work in progress and is not designed to be usable. Currently it's a collection of notes that will be used to build the final map.

## Notes

Given the FPS nature of part of the game many users are going to want to use the keyboard. As a result we shouldn't change any keyboard bindings as part of this map. We may need to add bindings for unmapped functions.

## Default Game Bindings

### Flight - Cockpit

| Action        | Binding                   | Possible location          |
| ============= | ========================= | ========================== |
| Eject         | Right `Alt` + `l`         | `Throttle Btn 1`           |
| Exit Seat     | Left `Ctrl` + `f`         | `Throttle` somewhere       |
| Self Destruct | Right `Alt` + `Backspace` | `shift` + `Throttle Btn 1` |
| Light         | `o`                       | `Throttle Hat 1 Down`      |

> Notes: Eject and self destruct want to be difficult to hit - `Throttle Btn 1` seems ideal, although it may be too much of a pain in the heat of combat. The light doesn't strike me as requiring easy access.

### Fligt - View

| Action                | Binding                  | Possible location          |
| ===================== | ======================== | ========================== |
| Look Left             | none                     | `Stick POV Hat`            |
| Look Right            | none                     | `Stick POV Hat`            |
| Look Up               | none                     | `Stick POV Hat`            |
| Look Down             | none                     | `Stick POV Hat`            |
| Cycle view            | `Insert`                 | `Stick` somewhere (`POV`?) |
| Cycle camera orbit    | `Page up`                | `Stick` somewhere          |
| Zoom In (3rd person)  | `Mouse Wheel`            | `Stick` somewhere          |
| Zoom Out (3rd person) | `Nouse Wheel`            | `Stick` somewhere          |
| Freelook (hold)       | Left `Alt`               | `Stick` somewhere          |
| Freelook (toggle)     | Double tap Left `Alt`    | `Stick` somehwere          |
| Dynamic zoom          | `maxis_z`?               | ?                          |
| Look behind           | Left `Ctrl` + Left `Alt` | `Stick` somewhere          |

> Notes: Given the view controls are more extensive than Elite we're going to need to overload the `POV` hat, and probably pressgang some other buttons or hats into service.
